That is a project written in Spring Boot which purpose is to help front end developers in testing their applications.
Its basically a database in txt and a server that has many different endpoints sending data for various needs.
For example one to send data of records with clothes including the brand, name, description and link for the image
so the site even in development looks professional and you know that the requests actually work
additionally there is a wake to make money from this by sending data promoting our sponsors
lets say our sponsor is nike and we send a set of shoes all Air Jordans or when returing object with an additional record of only writing from sponsor
